This project is implementations of various recommendation algorithms, designed to provide accurate and scalable recommendations for real-world applications. The approaches include:

Collaborative Filtering: Both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques to recommend items based on user similarities.
Deep Learning: Leveraging deep learning at scale, including the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for session-based recommendations.
Matrix Factorization: Utilizing methods such as SVD and SVD++ to model user-item interactions.
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs): For building recommendation systems using neural networks.
Hybrid and Ensemble Models: Combining multiple algorithms to create robust and accurate hybrid systems.
K-Nearest-Neighbors: Implementing KNN for item recommendation.
Cold Start Solutions: Solving the cold start problem with content-based recommendations.
Large-Scale Computation: Using Apache Spark to scale recommendation computations efficiently on a cluster.
Real-World Learnings: Drawing from real-world case studies like Netflix and YouTube to improve system performance.
Evaluation Framework: A custom framework to test and measure recommendation algorithm performance using appropriate success metrics.
This repository aims to provide a flexible and scalable foundation for building advanced recommender systems for various applications.
